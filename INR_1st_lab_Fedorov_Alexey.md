## Task 1

```
To make it easier to prototype network topologies and troubleshoot them, you will be using GNS3
software to emulate networks.

1. Install the needed dependencies for GNS3: QEMU/KVM, Docker and Wireshark.
Hint: Check that virtualization is enabled in your bios. Make sure that the user belongs to all the
necessary groups after installing the tools.

2. Start a GNS3 project, configure the pre-installed Ubuntu Cloud Guest template. Check that
you can start it.

3. What are the different ways you can configure internet access in GNS3?
Test them with a single created VM and give a one-line description of each.
What are the differences between them?
Bonus: show the difference between them on practice and test the connectivity
